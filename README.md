# Pizza-App

Crafted with a blend of Kotlin and Java within the Android Studio environment, this pizza application exemplifies a seamless union of programming prowess and user-centric design. A significant facet of the project is dedicated to the meticulous design of a user interface using Views in Android Studio's layout editor.

The application unfolds as a culinary journey for the user, offering an interactive experience in selecting the perfect pizza. Through an intuitive dropdown menu, users can explore a variety of pizza types, customize their pizza size with the aid of radio buttons, and elevate their adventure with extra toppings, effortlessly managed through checkboxes. Dynamic in its nature, the Subtotal dynamically adjusts as users toggle their choices, offering a real-time reflection of the selected items.

Beyond mere customization, the application introduces a layer of financial transparency. The total price is intricately calculated, incorporating the user's preferred tip, facilitated by Android's slider, and introducing an optional $2 delivery fee. This nuanced approach ensures a tailored and responsive pricing mechanism, aligning with the user's preferences.

Upon finalizing the order, the application seamlessly transitions to another window, presenting a comprehensive display. Here, the selected pizza, its chosen ingredients, and the corresponding price are elegantly showcased. This user-centric design not only enhances the overall ordering experience but also provides users with a visual confirmation of their delectable choices.
